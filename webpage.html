                     <p>    I have choosen to develop this Webb-app beacuse my teacher told me to.</p>
                     <p>I have choosen to devleop this website using webb-app beacuse thats the only way of coding i currently know</p>
                     <p>If i had choosen Hybrid-app it could be for all platforms. You dont need a webbrowser when you use hybrid-app to open it.</p>
                     <p>Hybrid-app are easier to develop than native-app that makes hybrid-app cheaper to develop</p>
                     <p>Easier to come into the storage with hybrid-app that customers or even the owner could appreciate</p>
                     <p>Native-app Internet connection is not needed depending on what the app is going to do</p>
                     <p>Native-app you can achive higher security possebility wich is good for not getting hacked or for info of the website to leak. </p>
                     <p>Native-app got better UX. its easier to understand  for the cusstomers/visitors</p>
                     <p>Web-app easier to build then example native-app that makes the end price of the apps so diffrent. web-app is cheaper. </p>
                     <p>Hybrid-app are slower than native-app so if you want your app to be fast ask for native-app</p>
